# Friday-Night-Relief
GitHub version of the mod...

Friday Night Funkin' but somehow...it's really shiny...

Friday Night Relief is just the same as original but I added the effect called "relief" on the backgrounds and UI. It's a effect that makes things look shiny and it's from IbisPaint. This thing is literally filling up my phone storage XD

(NOTE: this mod isn't done yet. It only has the UI and week 1 bg filtered. I'm lazy xD)
